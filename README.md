# paceman-ai
•	Implemented BFS, DFS, A*, Hill Climbing, Genetic Algorithm and Monte Carlo Tree Search on Berkeley Pacman AI game resulting in Pacman winning on it’s own in case of some algorithms

•	Built a perceptron classifier to learn from recorded Pacman games as training algorithms, and ran the classifier to determine which action would be taken by the observed agent
